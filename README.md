<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project 

BYO - YAML Parser is a project developed for educational purposes, following the guidelines set forth by John Crickett's Coding Challenges, which can be explored [here](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-yaml). The primary objective of this project is to deepen understanding of fundamental technologies through the implementation of a YAML parsing solution, while also exploring each block of code further.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This project was developed with educational objectives in mind, aiming to deepen understanding of Python programming concepts and application development practices. The project structure includes a docs folder containing markdown files that provide detailed explanations and walkthroughs for different sections of the codebase. Each markdown file breaks down complex functionalities into manageable steps, making it easier to follow along and learn. By building this project, I aimed to gain hands-on experience in Python development, reinforce programming fundamentals, and explore best practices in software documentation and project organization.
